## 🛡️ Phishing Detection
> Real-time phishing URL classifier using XGBoost, deployed with Amazon SageMaker, Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.

- Predicts phishing vs. legitimate URLs using features derived directly from the URL string  
- Fully serverless and low-latency deployment  
- Frontend demo hosted via S3 static website

## 📷 SentryCam - AWS
> Smart surveillance camera pipeline that detects high-risk vehicles near ATMs, built with Amazon SageMaker, Lambda, Step Functions, and SNS.

- Uses deep learning (CNN) to classify whether a vehicle is suspicious or not  
- Event-driven design triggered by image uploads to S3  
- Sends real-time alerts via email for suspicious detections

## ✈️ Aero-Delay-Project
> End-to-end flight delay analysis and prediction pipeline. Features data ingestion and cleaning, feature engineering (scheduling, weather, airport traffic), model training and evaluation, and deployment for batch inference and monitoring on AWS.

- Predicts flight departure/arrival delays using historical flight, weather, and schedule data  
- Includes exploratory data analysis, feature pipelines, and model evaluation notebooks  
- Deployment-ready artifacts and scripts for batch inference with SageMaker
