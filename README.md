# AWS Machine Learning Projects

This portfolio features two end-to-end machine learning projects I developed while completing the **Udacity AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree**. Each solution demonstrates practical use of core AWS services with a focus on real-time inference, serverless deployment, and scalable architecture.

## 🛡️ Phishing Detection
> Real-time phishing URL classifier using XGBoost, deployed with Amazon SageMaker, Lambda, API Gateway, and S3.

- Predicts phishing vs. legitimate URLs using features derived directly from the URL string  
- Fully serverless and low-latency deployment  
- Frontend demo hosted via S3 static website

## 📷 SentryCam - AWS
> Smart surveillance camera pipeline that detects high-risk vehicles near ATMs, built with Amazon SageMaker, Lambda, Step Functions, and SNS.

- Uses deep learning (CNN) to classify whether a vehicle is suspicious or not  
- Event-driven design triggered by image uploads to S3  
- Sends real-time alerts via email for suspicious detections
